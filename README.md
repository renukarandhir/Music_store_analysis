# Music_Store_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a real-world music store database to:

- Analyze customer transactions and preferences.
- Identify high-value customers and top-selling genres/artists.
- Understand sales trends by country and media types.

The project helped me develop practical SQL skills and understand how databases can drive business intelligence.

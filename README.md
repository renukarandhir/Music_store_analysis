# Music_Store_Analysis

In this project, I worked with a real-world music store database to:

- Analyze customer transactions and preferences.
- Identify high-value customers and top-selling genres/artists.
- Understand sales trends by country and media types.

The project helped me develop practical SQL skills and understand how databases can drive business intelligence.

## Business Questions Answered

I wrote SQL queries to answer the following:

1.	Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
2.	Which countries have the most Invoices?
3.	What are top 3 values of total invoice?
4.	Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals?
5.	Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money?
6.	Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A?
7.	Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands?
8.	Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first?
